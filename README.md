Development of this project with python has stopped at an early stage to instead develop the game with the help of Unity

# Sabobatage-Online
A fan project to create an online version of the card game, Sabobatage.  
Utilizes python to create a card game that supports 2-5 Players.

The game consists of cards that are in 4 Categories: Topping, Tea Base, Flavor, and Action.  
Each player's goal is to create "Drinks" which consist of 3 cards that have to be a Topping with a compatible Flavor, and a Tea Base.  
Other players can sabotage other people's drinks as they try to complete a specific number of drinks to win (3-5 drinks based on players).

Disclaimer: This project is just for personal use for fun and to gain coding experience, the actual card game is a product that I am copying from to make an online version of.
